# JSX to React Element Object Converter
This tool converts JSX code (e.g. from Vercel OG Playground) into plain React element objects (JSON format) compatible with Satori.
Useful for quickly transforming JSX-based styles into object format for use in non-React Satori components.

Note:
Vercel OG Playground only supports JSX, but Satori (outside React) requires React element objects.
This tool was created to bridge that gap for personal use.
